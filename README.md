# 3d-portfolio

Inspirated by adrianhajdin(AKA JSMastery on YouTube) and Bruno Simon. (consider to purchase both JSMastery and Bruno Simon courses)

3D models are made almost entirely by me(got some textures from Polygon and BlenderKit)

In order to use this you have to run this commands:

```git clone https://github.com/marcoperinidev/3d-portfolio.git```

```npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion react-router-dom```

...and give the credit to me and adrianhajdin.

## For the 3D models I don't think makes sense to use mine(and I don't give the permission to do so)
###### cause they are literally what's in my real room where I work and I spent day to make em.
###### You can find free 3D models on sketchfab or other 3d free models sites.

*Consider to give this a star if you feel so.*

#### Feel free to ask me anything here, on my email, or Instagram(marco_perini_dev)
